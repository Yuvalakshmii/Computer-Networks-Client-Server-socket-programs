/*write a c program of Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to print the codeword on server side.
1. On client side, it should get input of data and divisor, which should be transmitted to serever to perform CRC calculation on server side.
2. on server side, it should output the codeword(data+CRC), whee CRC is the last three digits of the codeword.
input:
enter data: 1001
enter divisor: 1011

output:
codeword: 1001110

the CRC in the output is last three digit: 110
